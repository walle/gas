h2. Description

Gas is a mighty utility that helps you keep track of your multiple git authors.  Add them to gas and switch between them instantly!  Great if you use one author at work and one at home or if you are doing pair programming.  

h2. Installation

The best way to install gas is with RubyGems:

bc. $ [sudo] gem install gas

You can install from source:

bc. $ cd gas/
$ bundle
$ rake install

h2. Running

The default task is to list authors

bc. $ gas

bc. $ gas list

This lists the authors that are set up in the ~/.gas/gas.authors file.

You can import your current user by giving it a nickname

bc. $ gas import current_user

To add an author use, add

bc. $ gas add walle "Fredrik Wallgren" fredrik.wallgren@gmail.com

And the main usage, use

bc. $ gas use walle

To delete it again use, delete

bc. $ gas delete walle

Gas can also juggle your id_rsa ssh keys, which is helpful for uploading to github between multiple accounts.  Indespensible for teachers who need to instruct their students on how to use github!

bc. $ gas add Njax NotarySojac no@mail.com
Do you want gas to handle switching rsa keys for this user?
