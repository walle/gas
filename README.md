**Gas is the Git Author Switcher.** Do you have a personal and a work email and use the same computer to commit? Try gas to help you switch between the two.
Do you pair program and want to reflect that it's not only you writing the code? Use gas to switch between you and your partner's commiter.

Gas is extensible.

## Get it

The best way to install gas is with `gem`:

    $ sudo gem install gas

You can also install it from source:

    $ cd gas/
    $ bundle
    $ rake install

<a name="use_it"></a>
## Use it

* `add PROFILE NAME EMAIL` - adds a new user to gas
* `delete PROFILE` - deletes a user from gas
* `import PROFILE` - imports the user from .gitconfig into PROFILE
* `list` - lists all users
* `plugins` - lists all installed plugins
* `show` - shows the current user
* `use PROFILE` - sets the user with PROFILE as the current user

The default task is to list authors

    $ gas

    $ gas list

This lists the authors that are set up in the ~/.gas/gas.users file.

You can import your current user by giving it a PROFILE

    $ gas import current_user

To add an author use, add

    $ gas add walle "Fredrik Wallgren" fredrik.wallgren@gmail.com

And the main usage, use

    $ gas use walle

To delete it again use, delete

    $ gas delete walle

View the help using

    $ gas -h

## Extend it

Gas is built to be extendable, it uses the same way git does. Any executable in your PATH named gas-yourplugin is useable with gas.
This means you can write extensions for gas in any language you want, the only thing you need to do is make it accessable by putting it in PATH.

To extend already existing commands make an executable with the name gas-yourplugin-existingcommand eg. gas-stats-use to do something when the original use command is executed.
This makes it possible to extend plugins too eg. gas-myplugin-stats will extend the stats command, if installed.

An example plugin exists at https://github.com/walle/gas_stats it's written in ruby, and distributed with rubygems. But this is not a requirement.

Some plugins extend gas by adding functionality to built-in commands (ex. gas-stats) as well as by adding its own functionality (ex. gas-ssh).
